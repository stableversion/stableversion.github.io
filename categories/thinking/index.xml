      <description>All Worlds Made By Yayoichan. (猫屋敷やよい)
I often get lost in these worlds. There&amp;rsquo;s one thing of seeing it on screen, but another of actually feeling like being there.
One of my favorite things to do is to invite other people into these worlds and listen to what kinds of feelings and associations they have with it, and it always tends to be different from anyone else. This is also the reason I like music, there’s one way a creator imagined it, but another way of how the listener/viewer interpreted it, and what associations they have with it.</description>
